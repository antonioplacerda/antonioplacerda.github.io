      <description>I will try to explain a bit the SOLID principles, that should be engraved in every software engineer mind!
This one is about the Single Responsibility Principle, yes it is the S in SOLID! (shocking, I know!)
This principle states that:
 Every software component should have one and only one responsibility
 In order to better understand this principle, we need to talk about cohesion and coupling:
 Cohesion is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related; Coupling is defined as the level of inter dependency between various software components.</description>

      <title>Creating my first DApp</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to get my Q3 goals going and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with the DApp!
I will do this in 4 steps:
 Create a lottery contract using the remix platform; Create a frontend to interact with the contract, that should be connected to metamask; Deploy the contract to a testnet like Rinkeby; Maybe deploy the app to heroku.  So, the contract should be able to:
 Allow players to enter the lottery with a fixed amount of ether, like 0.</description>

      <description>OK, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to define some priorities. Having dreams is great, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get anything done. And also, having them in kind of a blob is also no good!
I know I want to improve my technical skills to feel more comfortable taking on any new challenge that I might face. I know I want to learn more about blockchains and smart contracts. I know I want to improve my trading skills.</description>

      <description>A full year is too long to set goals. It&amp;rsquo;s a bettter timespan to set dreams, that will get translated into goals for each quarter, that should get translated into projects and then into concrete small actions. I will try to do that, since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent these past quarters dreaming about these goals!
But, for now, here are my dreams for 2021:
 Create a simple DCA trading bot for DeFi; Start a &amp;ldquo;strategy&amp;rdquo; journal, where I will implement several trading strategies and backtest them; Improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge; Improve my system design skills; Improve my pattern recognition for trading skills; Create a simple DApp in the ethereum blockchain; Create a bot to automatically claim rewards from farms and swap them; Create an explorer sniffer, that will fetch all transactions for the supplied address; Create a portfolio app, that will get the records from several exchanges; Add the explorer info to the portfolio app; Create an arbitrageur bot for CEX; Create an arbitrageur bot for DEX; Improve my go skills;  </description>
