			<p>I wanted to get an app live and <a href="https://salty-badlands-66972.herokuapp.com/">here</a> it is!
I followed a tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g">code drip</a> to help me start this.
Since this was supposed to be a simple test of my skills, I didn&rsquo;t want to pay for a hosting solution. I checked digital ocean, amazon web services and google cloud platform. I also tried firebase, but it also seemed an overkill.
So, I went with heroku!
Initially I had an express app running for the api where it would only fetch the data from the redis database, a worker with a scheduled cron job and the react server for the frontend.
In heroku I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to expose both ports, so I went with a single express app for the frontend and for the api.
I had to tweak the package.json files a lot to get to where the app is right now, but I like the final result!
