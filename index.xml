      <description>Estranho, tantas resoluções de ano novo, tanta coisa que ia fazer em janeiro, tantas alterações basilares que ia fazer à minha vida e ficou tudo igual. Mas igual até pode nem ser verdade, o mais certo até deve ser dizer que ficou tudo pior. Porque a atitude não mudou mas a resoluções ficaram lá sem serem assumidas. Isto fez com que fossem pesando um bocado e fossem fazendo com que me sentisse mal a cada dia que passava.</description>

      <title>Full stack react redis app</title>

      <description>I wanted to get an app live and here it is! I followed a tutorial from code drip to help me start this. Since this was supposed to be a simple test of my skills, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for a hosting solution. I checked digital ocean, amazon web services and google cloud platform. I also tried firebase, but it also seemed an overkill. So, I went with heroku! Initially I had an express app running for the api where it would only fetch the data from the redis database, a worker with a scheduled cron job and the react server for the frontend.</description>

      <title>Docker Commands</title>

      <description>This is a list of every docker command I find useful and a bit of info about it. It is not intended to be a tutorial of any kind, but maybe someone will find this list as useful as I consider it to be!
General  docker version - if any error here, docker is probably not running. If on linux, do a sudo docker info - a lot more info about the docker installation  Containers  docker container run IMAGE - first it gets an image from local machine, if it doesn’t find one, tries to get one from docker hub.</description>

      <title>Remove Diacritics</title>

      <description>If you ever faced the terror of finding a diacritic that messed up some of your regex, or some awesome script you&amp;rsquo;ve written, then we are on the same boat. Although I love my language, portuguese, messing up with scripts is never a good way to make friends, so I often need to remove those annoying characters from sentences and every time I need to do so I go surf the web for the same answer.</description>

      <description>This is my first post. This is the beginning of something amazing, I hope. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to give back to the community for a long time but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to. Well, this is how I plan to start! I want to have a place where I put everything I learn, that is accessible everywhere and to everyone. No better place than here. I also wanted to create something hackable but not fully from scratch, since it would take longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>
