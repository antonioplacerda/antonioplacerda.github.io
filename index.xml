      <description>This is a list of every docker command I find useful and a bit of info about it. It is not intended to be a tutorial of any kind, but maybe someone will find this list as useful as I consider it to be!
General  docker version - if any error here, docker is probably not running. If on linux, do a sudo docker info - a lot more info about the docker installation  Containers  docker container run IMAGE - first it gets an image from local machine, if it doesnâ€™t find one, tries to get one from docker hub.</description>

      <description>If you ever faced the terror of finding a diacritic that messed up some of your regex, or some awesome script you&amp;rsquo;ve written, then we are on the same boat. Although I love my language, portuguese, messing up with scripts is never a good way to make friends, so I often need to remove those annoying characters from sentences and every time I need to do so I go surf the web for the same answer.</description>

      <description>This is my first post. This is the beginning of something amazing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to give back to the community for a long time but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to. Well, this is how I plan to start! I want to have a place where I put everything I learn, that is accessible everywhere and to everyone. No better place than here. I also wanted to create something hackable but not fully from scratch, since it would take longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>
