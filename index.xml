      <title>Creating my first DApp</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to get my Q3 goals going and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with the DApp!
I will do this in 4 steps:
 Create a lottery contract using the remix platform; Create a frontend to interact with the contract, that should be connected to metamask; Deploy the contract to a testnet like Rinkeby; Maybe deploy the app to heroku.  So, the contract should be able to:
 Allow players to enter the lottery with a fixed amount of ether, like 0.</description>

      <title>2021 Q3 Goals</title>

      <description>OK, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to define some priorities. Having dreams is great, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get anything done. And also, having them in kind of a blob is also no good!
I know I want to improve my technical skills to feel more comfortable taking on any new challenge that I might face. I know I want to learn more about blockchains and smart contracts. I know I want to improve my trading skills.</description>

      <description>A full year is too long to set goals. It&amp;rsquo;s a bettter timespan to set dreams, that will get translated into goals for each quarter, that should get translated into projects and then into concrete small actions. I will try to do that, since I&amp;rsquo;ve spent these past quarters dreaming about these goals!
But, for now, here are my dreams for 2021:
 Create a simple DCA trading bot for DeFi; Start a &amp;ldquo;strategy&amp;rdquo; journal, where I will implement several trading strategies and backtest them; Improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge; Improve my system design skills; Improve my pattern recognition for trading skills; Create a simple DApp in the ethereum blockchain; Create a bot to automatically claim rewards from farms and swap them; Create an explorer sniffer, that will fetch all transactions for the supplied address; Create a portfolio app, that will get the records from several exchanges; Add the explorer info to the portfolio app; Create an arbitrageur bot for CEX; Create an arbitrageur bot for DEX; Improve my go skills;  </description>

      <title>A felicidade de ter desafios ou o ter de escolher entre trabalhos</title>

      <description>Tenho uma decisão para tomar! Numa última reunião que tive com um grupo de vários casais, estivemos a falar de desafios. Isto abriu-nos os olhos, enquanto casal, para a diferença que faz olhar para as coisas como desafios e não problemas. O quanto ver tudo como problema nos fecha dentro de uma espiral descendente é impressionante.
Fez-me voltar a estar agradecido por ter a sorte de não ter dias totalmente monótonos, de poder pensar nas coisas que me acontecem.</description>

      <title>Ano Novo ou A Liberdade de ser Cristão</title>

      <description>Estranho, tantas resoluções de ano novo, tanta coisa que ia fazer em janeiro, tantas alterações basilares que ia fazer à minha vida e ficou tudo igual. Mas igual até pode nem ser verdade, o mais certo até deve ser dizer que ficou tudo pior. Porque a atitude não mudou mas a resoluções ficaram lá sem serem assumidas. Isto fez com que fossem pesando um bocado e fossem fazendo com que me sentisse mal a cada dia que passava.</description>

      <title>Full stack react redis app</title>

      <description>I wanted to get an app live and here it is! I followed a tutorial from code drip to help me start this. Since this was supposed to be a simple test of my skills, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for a hosting solution. I checked digital ocean, amazon web services and google cloud platform. I also tried firebase, but it also seemed an overkill. So, I went with heroku! Initially I had an express app running for the api where it would only fetch the data from the redis database, a worker with a scheduled cron job and the react server for the frontend.</description>

      <title>Docker Commands</title>

      <description>This is a list of every docker command I find useful and a bit of info about it. It is not intended to be a tutorial of any kind, but maybe someone will find this list as useful as I consider it to be!
General  docker version - if any error here, docker is probably not running. If on linux, do a sudo docker info - a lot more info about the docker installation  Containers  docker container run IMAGE - first it gets an image from local machine, if it doesn’t find one, tries to get one from docker hub.</description>

      <title>Remove Diacritics</title>
      <link>https://antonioplacerda.github.io/posts/20190706-diacritics/</link>

      <description>If you ever faced the terror of finding a diacritic that messed up some of your regex, or some awesome script you&amp;rsquo;ve written, then we are on the same boat. Although I love my language, portuguese, messing up with scripts is never a good way to make friends, so I often need to remove those annoying characters from sentences and every time I need to do so I go surf the web for the same answer.</description>

      <description>This is my first post. This is the beginning of something amazing, I hope. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to give back to the community for a long time but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to. Well, this is how I plan to start! I want to have a place where I put everything I learn, that is accessible everywhere and to everyone. No better place than here. I also wanted to create something hackable but not fully from scratch, since it would take longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>
